# Sound Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview
This project explores an approach based on the use of MATLAB and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to distinguish between different types of sounds. Specifically, the sounds of sneezing, snoring, and crying are analyzed using spectral and temporal features.

### Features in Time Domain
- **Energy**: The magnitude of the signal.
- **Zero Crossing Rate**: The frequency at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back.

### Features in Frequency Domain
- **Spectral Centroid**: The main point of the spectrum distribution.
- **Spectral Spread**: The standard deviation of the spectrum distribution.
- **Spectral Rolloff**: The amount of energy accumulated until a certain point in the frequency.
- **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**: Represents the spectrum bands according to the mel-scale, an isophonic (mostly subjective) coefficient.
